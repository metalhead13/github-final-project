forthebadge forthebadge

Gem Version CI PRs Welcome

A Ruby script that colorizes the ls output with color and icons. Here are the screenshots of working example on an iTerm2 terminal (Mac OS), oh-my-zsh with powerlevel9k theme and powerline nerd-font + awesome-config font with the Solarized Dark color theme.

If you're interested in knowing the powerlevel9k configuration to get this prompt, have a look at this gist.

rbenv rehash
rehash
Enable tab completion for flags by entering following line to your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc) :

source $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/tab_complete.sh
Start using colorls ðŸŽ‰

Have a look at Recommended configurations and Custom configurations.

Recommended configurations
(Back to top)

To add some short command (say, lc) with some flag options (say, -l, -A, --sd) by default, add this to your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.) :

alias lc='colorls -lA --sd'
For changing the icon(s) to other unicode icons of choice (select icons from here), change the YAML files in a text editor of your choice (say, subl)

subl $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml
Custom configurations
(Back to top)

You can overwrite the existing icons and colors mapping by copying the yaml files from $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml into ~/.config/colorls, and changing them.

To overwrite color mapping :

Please have a look at the list of supported color names. You may also use a color hex code as long as it is quoted within the YAML file and prefaced with a # symbol.

Let's say that you're using the dark color scheme and would like to change the color of untracked file (??) in the --git-status flag to yellow. Copy the defaut dark_colors.yaml and change it.

Check if the ~/.config/colorls directory exists. If it doesn't exist, create it using the following command:

mkdir -p ~/.config/colorls
And then

cp $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml/dark_colors.yaml ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml
In the ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml file, change the color set for untracked from darkorange to yellow, and save the change.

untracked: yellow
Or, using hex color codes:

untracked: '#FFFF00'
